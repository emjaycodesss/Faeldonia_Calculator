The equal symbol button is different from other buttons because it utilizes a new library known as mXparser. It is a versatile mathematical expression parser for Java that can evaluate expressions dynamically. This feature allows your application to interpret and calculate mathematical formulas provided by the user at runtime which enhances the calculator's functionality significantly. With mXparser, the application can support a wide range of mathematical operations, from basic arithmetic to advanced functions.

mXparser is well-suited for applications requiring mathematical calculation capabilities, as it not only supports numerical computation but also symbolic computation, including differentiation, integration, and more. It comes with a rich set of built-in functions and operators and allows for the creation of custom functions and variables.

To download the appropriate version of mXparser that is compatible with JDK 17, you can visit the official [mXparser website](https://mathparser.org/mxparser-downloads/) or check out their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mariuszgromada/MathParser.org-mXparser). From there, you can select the binary distribution that matches your JDK version and integrate it into your project's library to enhance your application's calculation capabilities.
